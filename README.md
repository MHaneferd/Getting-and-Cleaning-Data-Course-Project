#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is my submission to the Coursera Peer Graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The submission consist of;
- This repo in Github
- A Readme file (this file)
- A CodeBook (CodeBook.md)
- A R-script (run_analysis.R) file
- A tidy dataset uploaded directly to Coursera. ( This file is not in this Repo, but can be created with the run_analysis.R script)

## Files in the deliverables

###README.md
This README.me file is decribing the different deliverables and how they are connected.
It also outlines some of the details in the files in the repo.

###[CodeBook.md](https://github.com/MHaneferd/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/master/CodeBook.md)
The CodeBook file consists of an overview description of the project goals, and the outcome of the project.
It includes some study design and data processing of the raw data, how it is collected and how the different raw data files are connected to each other.
There is a section of a guide for how to create the Tidy Dataset (Which are uploaded to Coursera), and a process description on how the raw data files are cleaned. And a description of the variables in the output file (The tidy_average_activity_data.txt file.)
At the end of the CodeBook, the major sources for where the information of how I got to the end result are listed.
